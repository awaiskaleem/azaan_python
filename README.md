# azaan_python

The short script azaan.py uses MuslimPro as source of timings. I developed this for Stockholm city for which city id is 2673730. 
To run the code, simply run following command.
`pipenv run python azaan.py 2673730`

Note that the code is supposed to run in background and has an infinte loop in it.
To find the city code refer to this link [https://support.muslimpro.com/hc/en-us/articles/202886274-How-do-I-add-Muslim-Pro-prayer-times-on-my-own-web-page-]
